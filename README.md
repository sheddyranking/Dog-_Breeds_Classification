# Dog_Breeds_Classification
Using Transfer Learning and TensorFlow to Classify Different Dog Breeds

## Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog when given an imaged of a dog. for example when sitting at a stadium and i take a photo of a dog, i want to know what breed it is.

## Data
The data that we are using is from kaggle dogs breeds identification competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data

## Evaluation
The Evaluation is to submit a file with predictable probabilities for each Dog breed for each test image. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/overview/evaluation

## Features
some information about the data:
* we are dealing with images (unstructured data) so it is probably best we use Deep Learning/Transfer Learning.
* There 120 Breeds of Dogs(there are 120 different classes)
* There are around 10,000+ images in the training set (this images have labels)
* There are around 10,000+ images in the testing set (this images do not have labels because we will want to predict them).
